# Getting Started

## PCB

To get started with this project, you will need at least KiCAD 7. You can download KiCAD from the [KiCAD website](https://kicad.org/). You will find gerber files in each release, which you can use to order PCBs from a PCB manufacturer. Every files will be available in the PCB folder. For components, you can use the BOM file to order them from a distributor `Tattoo_Supply_bom_Vx.x.csv`.
